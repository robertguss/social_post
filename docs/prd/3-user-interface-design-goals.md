# 3. User Interface Design Goals

The core design principle is that the UI must be **simple and fast** as a productivity tool.

## Overall UX Vision

The application should prioritize utility and efficiency for the solo content creator, moving quickly from content creation to scheduling.

## Core Screens and Views

- **Authentication Screen:** Login/Signup (Clerk integration)
- **Connection Manager:** For linking X/Twitter and LinkedIn
- **Post Creation Form:** The primary, integrated workspace.
- **Dashboard/List View:** Main view for scheduled and pending posts.
- **History View:** Archival/Search view for past posts.

## Accessibility: None

_(Inherited from PRD - note: compliance with WCAG standards is a Phase 3 Nice-to-Have.)_

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

_(Mobile usage is secondary but should be functional.)_
