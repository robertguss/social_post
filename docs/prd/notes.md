# Notes

- Keep UI simple and fast - this is a productivity tool
- Avoid feature creep - resist adding complexity until core workflow is solid
- Consider each feature's impact on the primary workflow
- Mobile usage is secondary but should be functional
- This is a tool, not a product (initially) - build for speed and utility
