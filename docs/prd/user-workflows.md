# User Workflows

## Primary Workflow: Batch Content Creation

1. User drafts multiple posts in notes app
2. Opens scheduler app
3. For each piece of content:
   - Creates Twitter version first (working within 280 characters)
   - Expands content for LinkedIn version
   - Adds URL if applicable (same for both platforms)
   - Schedules Twitter post for specific time
   - Schedules LinkedIn post for staggered time (e.g., 30 mins later)
   - Reviews character counts and previews
   - Saves as scheduled post
4. Views calendar to ensure distribution looks good
5. App automatically publishes at scheduled times

## Secondary Workflow: Spontaneous Post Creation

1. User gets content idea
2. Opens scheduler app
3. Writes Twitter version
4. Expands for LinkedIn
5. Schedules both with staggered times
6. Continues work

## Tertiary Workflow: Using Templates

1. User browses swipe file
2. Finds relevant template/example
3. Clicks to populate new draft
4. Customizes for current topic
5. Schedules as normal
