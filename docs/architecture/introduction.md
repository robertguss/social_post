# Introduction

[cite\_start]This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Social Posting Scheduler**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration[cite: 632]. [cite\_start]It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack[cite: 632]. [cite\_start]This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined[cite: 633].

| 2025-10-30 | 1.0     | Initial draft, incorporating PRD and existing starter template analysis. | Winston (Architect) |

## Starter Template or Existing Project

The project is built on the **Convex + Next.js + Better Auth** starter template, which aligns with the PRD's specified stack: Next.js/Tailwind, Better Auth, and Convex Backend.

**Decision:** Maintain the current **Integrated Monorepo** style based on standard Next.js/Tailwind/Convex best practices, leveraging the starter's pre-configured structure and dependencies.
