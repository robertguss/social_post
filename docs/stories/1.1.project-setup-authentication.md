# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Authentication

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** a secure login and the base project structure,
**so that** I can begin connecting my accounts.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The Next.js project runs with the Clerk/Convex context provided.
2. A user can successfully sign up and log in via Clerk/Next.js components.
3. The main app route is protected by Clerk middleware.
4. The foundational Convex database is initialized with the `posts` and `user_connections` tables defined in the schema.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Configure Clerk Authentication** (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Verify Clerk API keys are set in environment variables
  - [ ] Ensure `app/layout.tsx` contains ClerkProvider wrapping the application
  - [ ] Configure `middleware.ts` to protect main app routes using Clerk middleware
  - [ ] Verify Clerk sign-up and sign-in components render correctly
  - [ ] Test successful user registration and login flow

- [ ] **Task 2: Configure Convex Backend Integration** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Verify Convex deployment URL is configured in environment variables
  - [ ] Ensure `ConvexClientProvider` is properly wrapping the application in `app/layout.tsx`
  - [ ] Verify Convex auth configuration in `convex/auth.config.ts` integrates with Clerk
  - [ ] Test that the Convex client connects successfully to the backend

- [ ] **Task 3: Define Convex Database Schema** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create `posts` table schema in `convex/schema.ts` with fields: `clerkUserId` (string), `status` (string), `twitterContent` (optional string), `linkedInContent` (optional string), `twitterScheduledTime` (optional number), `linkedInScheduledTime` (optional number), `url` (optional string), `errorMessage` (optional string), `retryCount` (optional number), `twitterPostId` (optional string), `linkedInPostId` (optional string)
  - [ ] Define index `by_user` on `["clerkUserId"]` for the `posts` table
  - [ ] Create `user_connections` table schema with fields: `clerkUserId` (string), `platform` (string), `accessToken` (string - will be encrypted), `refreshToken` (string - will be encrypted), `expiresAt` (number)
  - [ ] Define index `by_user_platform` on `["clerkUserId", "platform"]` for the `user_connections` table
  - [ ] Deploy the schema to Convex using `npx convex dev` or `npx convex deploy`

- [ ] **Task 4: Verify End-to-End Integration** (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Start the development environment with `npm run dev`
  - [ ] Verify the Next.js application loads without errors
  - [ ] Test user sign-up flow and verify user session is created
  - [ ] Test user login flow and verify protected routes are accessible
  - [ ] Verify Convex database tables are created and accessible via Convex dashboard
  - [ ] Confirm that unauthenticated users are redirected by middleware

- [ ] **Task 5: Unit Testing** (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Write unit tests for Clerk middleware configuration (verify route protection logic)
  - [ ] Write integration tests for Convex schema validation (verify table structure and indexes)
  - [ ] Test authentication flow with mock Clerk session
  - [ ] Verify all tests pass

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story establishes the foundational infrastructure for the Social Posting Scheduler application. The implementation follows a **Serverless Fullstack** architecture using Next.js for the frontend and Convex for the unified backend.

[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#technical-summary]

### Tech Stack Details

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15.5.4 with App Router
- **Backend/Database**: Convex ^1.28.0 (provides unified DB, realtime queries, and scheduled functions)
- **Authentication**: Clerk ^6.12.6 (single-user authentication and session management)
- **Language**: TypeScript ^5 (type safety throughout)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS ^4

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Repository Structure

The project uses an **Integrated Monorepo** structure:

```plaintext

```

### Data Models for This Story

This story requires implementing two critical data tables in `convex/schema.ts`:

#### 1. `posts` Table
Stores scheduled and published content.

**Key Fields:**
- `clerkUserId`: string (Clerk user ID)
- `status`: string (values: "draft" | "scheduled" | "publishing" | "published" | "failed")
- `twitterContent`: string (optional)
- `linkedInContent`: string (optional)
- `twitterScheduledTime`: number (optional, timestamp)
- `linkedInScheduledTime`: number (optional, timestamp)
- `url`: string (optional, for auto-commenting)
- `errorMessage`: string (optional)
- `retryCount`: number (optional)
- `twitterPostId`: string (optional)
- `linkedInPostId`: string (optional)

**Index:** `by_user` on `["clerkUserId"]` - enables fast lookup of all posts for the authenticated user

[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

#### 2. `user_connections` Table
Stores encrypted OAuth tokens for external platforms.

**Key Fields:**
- `clerkUserId`: string (Clerk user ID)
- `platform`: string (values: "twitter" | "linkedin")
- `accessToken`: string (must be encrypted before storage)
- `refreshToken`: string (must be encrypted before storage)
- `expiresAt`: number (timestamp)

**Index:** `by_user_platform` on `["clerkUserId", "platform"]` - enables quick, secure retrieval of credentials for a specific user and platform

[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

### Security Requirements

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- Clerk middleware (`middleware.ts`) protects core application routes on the client side
- All Convex Queries and Mutations must use `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` to verify the user is authenticated
- All data access must verify `userId` against the document's `clerkUserId` to ensure single-user isolation
- OAuth tokens stored in `user_connections` must be encrypted at the application level (implementation deferred to Story 1.3)

[Source: architecture/security.md#authentication-authorization]

### Component Architecture

**App Shell:**
- Location: `app/layout.tsx`
- Purpose: Provides Clerk and Convex contexts, handles global styling
- Must wrap application with both `ClerkProvider` and `ConvexClientProvider`

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture]

### Routing Architecture

The application uses the **Next.js App Router** structure. For this story, we need to ensure the base routing is functional with Clerk protection enabled.

Example protected routes (to be implemented in future stories):
- `app/schedule/page.tsx` (Post Creation/Scheduling)
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (List View / Post Management)
- `app/history/page.tsx` (Post History)

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]

### Development Commands Reference

**Starting Development:**
```bash
npm run dev              # Runs both frontend and Convex backend in parallel
npm run dev:frontend     # Next.js dev server only
npm run dev:backend      # Convex dev server only
npm run predev           # Convex dev + dashboard
```

**Convex Commands:**
```bash
npx convex dev           # Start Convex dev deployment
npx convex dashboard     # Open Convex dashboard
npx convex deploy        # Deploy Convex functions to production
```

## Testing

### Testing Standards

**Test Levels Required:**

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Framework: Jest (or equivalent)
   - Focus Areas: Middleware configuration logic, schema validation
   - Location: Create test files adjacent to implementation files (e.g., `middleware.test.ts`)

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Framework: Jest with mocking libraries
   - Focus Areas:
     - Authentication flow on protected routes
     - Convex database schema and index validation
     - Clerk/Convex integration via `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()`
   - Location: `__tests__/integration/` directory (create if needed)

### Error Handling for This Story

- Client/UI: Use error boundaries to catch and display authentication errors
- Ensure Clerk components handle authentication failures gracefully
- Log any connection errors with Convex for debugging

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#error-handling-strategy]

### Test Coverage Requirements

- All authentication middleware logic must have unit tests
- Database schema must be validated via integration tests
- Authentication flow must be tested end-to-end with mock user sessions
