# Story 4.4: Queue Management UI (Pause/Resume/Edit)

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** content creator,
**I want** to manage my recurring post queues,
**so that** I can pause, resume, or modify automated posting schedules.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A "Queues" page/tab is added to the main navigation displaying all user recurring queues.
2. Each queue card displays: original post content preview, interval, status (active/paused/completed), next scheduled time, and execution count.
3. Active queues display "Pause" and "Edit" buttons.
4. Paused queues display "Resume" and "Edit" buttons.
5. Clicking "Pause" changes queue status to "paused" and stops automatic scheduling.
6. Clicking "Resume" changes queue status to "active" and recalculates `nextScheduledTime`.
7. Clicking "Edit" opens a modal allowing changes to interval, max executions, and next scheduled time.
8. A "Delete Queue" option permanently removes the queue from the database (with confirmation prompt).
