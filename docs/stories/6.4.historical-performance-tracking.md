# Story 6.4: Historical Performance Tracking (Future)

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** content creator,
**I want** the system to learn from my posted content's performance,
**so that** time recommendations improve over time based on my audience.

**Note:** This story is a placeholder for future enhancement when API access to engagement metrics becomes available.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A `post_performance` table is defined in the Convex schema with fields: `postId`, `platform`, `publishedTime`, `engagementMetrics` (likes, shares, comments), `fetchedAt`.
2. A Convex action periodically fetches engagement metrics from Twitter/LinkedIn APIs (if access is available).
3. Fetched performance data is stored in the `post_performance` table linked to the original post.
4. The time suggestion algorithm considers historical performance when calculating recommendations (weighted average with research-based data).
5. Users can view a "Performance Insights" page showing their best-performing posting times.
6. This feature remains inactive until API access to engagement metrics is configured.
7. Documentation notes the API requirements and setup steps for enabling this feature.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Define post_performance table schema** (AC: 1)
- [ ] **Task 2: Research API access requirements** (AC: 2, 6)
- [ ] **Task 3: Create placeholder action for metric fetching** (AC: 2)
- [ ] **Task 4: Design performance-based algorithm enhancement** (AC: 4)
- [ ] **Task 5: Create Performance Insights page mockup** (AC: 5)
- [ ] **Task 6: Document API requirements** (AC: 7)
- [ ] **Task 7: Mark feature as future enhancement** (AC: 6)

## Dev Notes

**Status:** Future enhancement - depends on external API access.

This story establishes the data model and design for performance tracking but implementation is deferred until Twitter/LinkedIn API access for engagement metrics is available.
