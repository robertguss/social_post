# Story 4.3: Recurring Queue Data Model & Scheduler

## Status

Done

## Story

**As an** engineer,
**I want** a database schema and scheduling logic for recurring post queues,
**so that** posts can be automatically rescheduled at defined intervals.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A `recurring_queues` table is defined in the Convex schema with fields: `clerkUserId`, `originalPostId`, `status` (active/paused), `interval` (days), `nextScheduledTime`, `lastExecutedTime`, `executionCount`, `maxExecutions` (optional).
2. The `recurring_queues` table has an index `by_user_status` on `["clerkUserId", "status"]` for efficient active queue queries.
3. A Convex scheduled function runs daily to check for queues due for execution (`nextScheduledTime` <= now).
4. When a queue is due, the scheduled function clones the original post and schedules it using the existing publishing logic.
5. After execution, `nextScheduledTime` is updated to `lastExecutedTime` + `interval`, and `executionCount` is incremented.
6. If `maxExecutions` is set and reached, the queue status is automatically set to "completed".
7. All queue operations are scoped to the authenticated user's `clerkUserId`.

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story implements the core backend infrastructure for Epic 4's recurring post feature. It introduces automated content recycling via scheduled Convex functions that clone and repost content at defined intervals.

**Key Design Decisions:**

- Convex cron jobs run on a schedule (daily or hourly) to process due queues
- Queues are "active" by default but can be paused/resumed by users
- `maxExecutions` provides optional limit for finite recurring schedules (e.g., "post this 4 times")
- Interval is stored in days (simple integer) and converted to milliseconds for timestamp calculations
- Queue processing is fault-tolerant: one failed queue doesn't block others
- Cloned posts via queues are marked with `createdByQueueId` for audit trail

[Source: docs/prd/6-epic-details.md:294-307]

### Data Models

**New Table: recurring_queues**

```typescript
recurring_queues: defineTable({
  clerkUserId: v.string(),
  originalPostId: v.id("posts"),
  status: v.string(), // "active" | "paused" | "completed"
  interval: v.number(), // Days between executions
  nextScheduledTime: v.number(), // Unix timestamp (ms)
  lastExecutedTime: v.optional(v.number()), // Unix timestamp (ms)
  executionCount: v.number(), // Total executions (default 0)
  maxExecutions: v.optional(v.number()), // Optional limit
})
  .index("by_user_status", ["clerkUserId", "status"])
  .index("by_next_scheduled", ["nextScheduledTime"]);
```

**Updated Table: posts**

Add new optional field:

- `createdByQueueId: v.optional(v.id("recurring_queues"))` - Links posts created by queues back to their source queue

[Source: docs/prd/6-epic-details.md:294-307, convex/schema.ts]

### Backend Architecture

**New Convex File: convex/queues.ts**

Contains all queue-related backend logic:

1. **Mutations:**
   - `createQueue` - Create new recurring queue
   - `updateQueue` - Modify queue settings (interval, maxExecutions, nextScheduledTime)
   - `deleteQueue` - Remove queue
   - `pauseQueue` - Set status to "paused" (stops auto-execution)
   - `resumeQueue` - Set status to "active" and recalculate nextScheduledTime

2. **Queries:**
   - `getQueues` - Fetch user's queues with optional status filter

3. **Scheduled Functions (Cron Jobs):**
   - `processQueues` - Runs on schedule (daily/hourly) to execute due queues

4. **Helpers:**
   - `cloneAndSchedulePost` - Clones post and schedules it for publishing

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md - Convex provides scheduled functions]

### Convex Scheduled Functions (Cron Jobs)

Convex provides built-in cron job support for running functions on a schedule:

**Configuration:**

```typescript
import { cronJobs } from "convex/server";

export const crons = cronJobs();

// Daily at midnight UTC
crons.daily(
  "process-recurring-queues",
  { hourUTC: 0, minuteUTC: 0 },
  internal.queues.processQueues,
);

// Or hourly at the top of the hour
crons.hourly(
  "process-recurring-queues",
  { minuteUTC: 0 },
  internal.queues.processQueues,
);
```

**Best Practices:**

- Use `internal` functions for cron jobs (not publicly callable)
- Handle errors gracefully (don't let one failure block batch)
- Log execution results for debugging
- Keep cron job functions fast (delegate heavy work to actions if needed)

[Source: CLAUDE.md - Convex scheduled functions are critical for timed publishing, docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 4.1 (Clone Past Post Functionality):**

- `clonePost` mutation demonstrates how to clone post content
- Security pattern: verify user owns original post before cloning
- Cloned posts should preserve content but clear scheduling/publishing fields
- Can reuse cloning logic for queue-generated posts

[Source: docs/stories/4.1.clone-past-post-functionality.md]

**From Story 1.5 (Core Publishing Logic - X Only):**

- Scheduling pattern: use `ctx.scheduler.runAt(scheduledTime, action, args)`
- Store scheduler IDs in post record for later cancellation
- Publishing actions are in `convex/publishing.ts`
- Reference: `api.publishing.publishToTwitter`, `api.publishing.publishToLinkedIn`

[Source: docs/stories/1.5.core-publishing-logic-x-only.md, CLAUDE.md - Scheduled Publishing Architecture]

**From Story 2.4 (LinkedIn Publishing Logic):**

- Dual platform scheduling: separate scheduler IDs for Twitter and LinkedIn
- Each platform gets its own scheduled action
- Scheduled times can differ between platforms

[Source: docs/stories/2.4.linkedin-publishing-logic.md]

### Time Calculations

**Converting interval (days) to milliseconds:**

```typescript
const intervalMs = interval * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // days to ms
// Or simplified:
const intervalMs = interval * 86400000;
```

**Calculating next scheduled time:**

```typescript
const nextScheduledTime = lastExecutedTime + interval * 86400000;
```

**Checking if queue is due:**

```typescript
const isDue = queue.nextScheduledTime <= Date.now();
```

### Security Considerations

- **Authorization**: All queue mutations MUST verify authenticated user owns the queue
- **Data Scoping**: Queues scoped by `clerkUserId` - users cannot access other users' queues
- **Original Post Validation**: When creating queue, verify user owns originalPostId
- **Cron Job Security**: Use `internal` namespace for scheduled functions (not publicly callable)

[Source: docs/architecture/security.md, CLAUDE.md - Authentication Flow]

### Error Handling Strategy

**In processQueues scheduled function:**

1. Wrap each queue execution in try-catch
2. Log errors but continue processing other queues
3. If original post is deleted, mark queue as "completed" or "failed"
4. If user connections are missing, skip execution and log warning
5. Don't send Telegram notifications for queue failures (too noisy) - handle via logging/monitoring

**In mutations:**

1. Validate all inputs (interval > 0, nextScheduledTime in future, etc.)
2. Check queue/post existence before operations
3. Return clear error messages for validation failures
4. Use Convex's built-in transaction handling (mutations are atomic)

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#error-handling-strategy]

### Testing

**Test Locations:**

- Backend tests: `convex/queues.test.ts`

**Testing Framework:**

- Jest for Convex function testing
- Mock Convex database and auth contexts
- Mock Date.now() for predictable time-based tests

**Key Test Cases:**

1. Unit: createQueue validates inputs and creates queue correctly
2. Unit: pauseQueue/resumeQueue change status appropriately
3. Unit: processQueues executes due queues and updates state
4. Unit: processQueues respects maxExecutions limit
5. Integration: Queue execution creates scheduled post with correct content
6. Integration: Queue execution schedules publishing actions
7. Security: Mutations enforce user ownership of queues and posts
8. Edge case: processQueues handles deleted original post gracefully

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Performance Considerations

**Indexing:**

- `by_user_status` index enables fast user queue lookups filtered by status
- `by_next_scheduled` index enables fast "due queues" queries in processQueues

**Scalability:**

- Daily cron job sufficient for MVP (single user)
- For multi-user version: consider batch processing or per-user job scheduling
- Limit query results to prevent timeouts (e.g., process max 100 queues per execution)

**Monitoring:**

- Log cron job execution results (queues processed, successes, failures)
- Track execution time to ensure cron completes within Convex limits
- Monitor failed executions for debugging
