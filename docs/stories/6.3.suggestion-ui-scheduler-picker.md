# Story 6.3: Suggestion UI in Scheduler Picker

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** content creator,
**I want** to see recommended posting times when scheduling content,
**so that** I can choose optimal times without researching best practices myself.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The date/time picker in the post creation form displays a "Recommended Times" section.
2. When the user selects a date, the "Recommended Times" section shows 3 suggested time slots for each enabled platform.
3. Each suggestion displays: time (in user's timezone), platform icon, and a brief reason (e.g., "High engagement window").
4. Clicking a suggested time auto-fills the corresponding platform's scheduled time field.
5. Recommendations update dynamically when the user changes the selected date or toggles platform selection.
6. If the user manually enters a time, suggestions remain visible but are not automatically applied.
7. A small info icon/tooltip explains the source of recommendations (e.g., "Based on industry research").
