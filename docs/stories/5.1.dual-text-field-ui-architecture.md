# Story 5.1: Dual Text Field UI Architecture

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** content creator,
**I want** separate, visually distinct text fields for Twitter and LinkedIn content,
**so that** I can clearly see and edit platform-specific content without confusion.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The post creation form displays two clearly labeled text areas: "Twitter/X Content" and "LinkedIn Content".
2. Each text area is visually distinct with platform branding (colors, icons).
3. Text areas are vertically stacked on mobile and can be displayed side-by-side on larger screens.
4. Each text area has independent focus state and cursor management.
5. Users can expand/collapse either text area to maximize editing space.
6. A toggle switch allows users to enable/disable posting to each platform independently.
7. When a platform is disabled, its text area is visually dimmed but content is preserved.

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

First story in Epic 5 (Enhanced Cross-Platform Adaptation). Refactors existing post composer from single field to dual fields.

**Note:** This enhances the existing basic dual-platform support from Story 2.3, making it more sophisticated with separate, clearly delineated fields.

## Testing

Tests for responsive layout, focus management, and platform toggles.
