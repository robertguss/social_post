# Story 5.2: Smart Content Pre-population (Twitter → LinkedIn)

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** content creator,
**I want** LinkedIn content to be automatically pre-filled with my Twitter content,
**so that** I can easily expand the shorter Twitter version into a longer LinkedIn post.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When the user finishes typing in the Twitter text field (2 second debounce), the system detects if LinkedIn field is empty.
2. If LinkedIn field is empty, a "Pre-fill LinkedIn" button appears above the LinkedIn text area.
3. Clicking "Pre-fill LinkedIn" copies the Twitter content exactly to the LinkedIn field.
4. Pre-population only occurs if the LinkedIn field is completely empty (not if it has content).
5. A visual indicator (e.g., "Pre-filled from Twitter") displays briefly after pre-population.
6. Users can manually clear or edit the LinkedIn content after pre-population without affecting Twitter content.
7. Pre-population can be disabled via user preferences/settings.
