# Story 7.3: Tone Adjustment Feature

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** content creator,
**I want** to adjust the tone of my content (formal, casual, engaging),
**so that** I can match the style to my audience and platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The "Adjust Tone" option presents tone choices: "More Formal", "More Casual", "More Engaging/Enthusiastic".
2. Selecting a tone sends the current post content to the Gemini API with a tone-specific prompt.
3. The Gemini API returns a rewritten version of the content matching the requested tone.
4. The rewritten content is displayed in a preview panel with the original content visible for comparison.
5. Users can accept the rewrite (replaces original), reject it (keeps original), or manually edit the suggestion.
6. Tone adjustment works independently for Twitter and LinkedIn content fields.
7. Character limits are respected - if the rewritten content exceeds limits, a warning is displayed and the user is prompted to manually shorten.
