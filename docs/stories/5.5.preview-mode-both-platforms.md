# Story 5.5: Preview Mode for Both Platforms Side-by-Side

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** content creator,
**I want** to preview how my content will appear on Twitter and LinkedIn simultaneously,
**so that** I can ensure optimal presentation before scheduling.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A "Preview" button is displayed in the post creation form.
2. Clicking "Preview" opens a modal showing side-by-side mockups of the Twitter and LinkedIn post appearance.
3. Twitter preview mimics the Twitter UI: avatar placeholder, content, character count visible, truncation if applicable.
4. LinkedIn preview mimics the LinkedIn feed UI: larger format, line breaks rendered, "see more" truncation at ~300 characters visible.
5. If a URL is provided, the preview shows "URL will be posted as a comment/reply" for each platform.
6. Preview updates dynamically if users make edits without closing the modal.
7. Preview modal is responsive: side-by-side on desktop, stacked on mobile.
