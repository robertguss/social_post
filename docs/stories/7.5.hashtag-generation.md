# Story 7.5: Hashtag Generation Based on Content

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** content creator,
**I want** AI-generated hashtag suggestions based on my post content,
**so that** I can improve discoverability without manual hashtag research.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The "Generate Hashtags" option analyzes the current post content in either the Twitter or LinkedIn field.
2. The Gemini API is sent a prompt to generate 3-5 relevant hashtags based on the content's topic and keywords.
3. The AI returns hashtags that are relevant, popular, and appropriate for the selected platform.
4. Generated hashtags are displayed in a suggestion panel with a brief explanation of why each hashtag is relevant (optional).
5. Users can select individual hashtags to insert into their post (at cursor position or appended at the end).
6. Users can select "Insert All" to add all suggested hashtags to their content.
7. Hashtag suggestions account for platform-specific conventions (e.g., LinkedIn accepts longer, more professional hashtags).
