# Story 5.6: Platform-Specific Post Drafts

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** content creator,
**I want** to save draft posts with platform-specific content independently,
**so that** I can work on Twitter and LinkedIn versions separately over time.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The post creation form has a "Save as Draft" button that saves the current state without scheduling.
2. Draft posts are stored in the `posts` table with status "Draft".
3. Draft posts preserve all content: Twitter content, LinkedIn content, URL, platform toggles, and any metadata.
4. The post history displays a "Drafts" filter/tab showing all draft posts.
5. Users can click on a draft to resume editing in the post creation form.
6. Drafts can be deleted individually with a confirmation prompt.
7. Draft timestamps show "Last edited: {relative time}" for easy tracking.

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes
