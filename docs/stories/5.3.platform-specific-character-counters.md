# Story 5.3: Platform-Specific Character Counters & Validation

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** content creator,
**I want** accurate, real-time character counters for each platform,
**so that** I know immediately if my content exceeds platform limits.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Twitter text field displays a character counter showing "X / 280" with current count and limit.
2. LinkedIn text field displays a character counter showing "X / 3,000" with current count and limit.
3. Counters update in real-time as the user types (no debounce).
4. Twitter counter shows warning styling (yellow/orange) at 260 characters.
5. Twitter counter shows error styling (red) at 280+ characters and the "Schedule" button is disabled.
6. LinkedIn counter shows warning styling at 2,900 characters.
7. LinkedIn counter shows error styling at 3,000+ characters and the "Schedule" button is disabled.
8. Character counting accounts for emoji, special characters, and URLs correctly per platform rules.
