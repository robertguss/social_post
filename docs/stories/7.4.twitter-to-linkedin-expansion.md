# Story 7.4: Twitter-to-LinkedIn Expansion

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** content creator,
**I want** to automatically expand my short Twitter content into a longer, more professional LinkedIn post,
**so that** I can save time when repurposing content.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The "Expand for LinkedIn" option is available when the Twitter content field has text and the LinkedIn field is empty or shorter.
2. Clicking "Expand for LinkedIn" sends the Twitter content to the Gemini API with a prompt to create a longer, professional version suitable for LinkedIn.
3. The Gemini API returns an expanded version (500-1000 characters) maintaining the core message but with more detail and professional tone.
4. The expanded content is displayed in the LinkedIn field preview panel.
5. Users can accept, reject, or edit the expanded content before applying it to the LinkedIn field.
6. The expansion maintains key elements like hashtags, mentions, and links from the original Twitter content.
7. If the Twitter content already references a URL, the expansion includes context about the link.
