# Story 5.4: Extended Content Field with Formatting Hints

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** content creator,
**I want** formatting hints and guidance for LinkedIn posts,
**so that** I can create professional, well-structured LinkedIn content.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The LinkedIn text area displays a subtle formatting toolbar or hint panel.
2. Formatting hints include: "Use line breaks for readability", "Add emojis for engagement", "Include hashtags at the end".
3. A "Tips" button/icon displays a popover with LinkedIn best practices (e.g., "First 2-3 lines are critical, longer posts get truncated").
4. The LinkedIn text area supports basic markdown preview (optional enhancement): line breaks, bold, bullet points.
5. Formatting hints are non-intrusive and can be dismissed/minimized.
6. Hints are context-aware: e.g., suggest adding hashtags if none are present in content > 100 characters.
7. All formatting guidance is informational only and does not enforce rules.
