# Story 7.2: AI Assistant UI Controls in Composer

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** content creator,
**I want** easily accessible AI assistant controls in the post composer,
**so that** I can quickly invoke AI features without disrupting my workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. An "AI Assistant" button/icon is displayed prominently in the post composer near the text input fields.
2. Clicking the "AI Assistant" button opens a popover/menu with options: "Adjust Tone", "Expand for LinkedIn", "Generate Hashtags".
3. Each AI feature displays a brief description of what it does.
4. When an AI feature is selected, a loading indicator displays while the AI processes the request.
5. AI-generated content appears in a preview/suggestion panel, not immediately replacing the user's content.
6. Users can "Accept", "Reject", or "Edit" AI suggestions before applying them to their post.
7. The AI Assistant UI is responsive and accessible on mobile devices.
