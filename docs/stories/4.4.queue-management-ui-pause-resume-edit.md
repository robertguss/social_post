# Story 4.4: Queue Management UI (Pause/Resume/Edit)

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** content creator,
**I want** to manage my recurring post queues,
**so that** I can pause, resume, or modify automated posting schedules.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A "Queues" page/tab is added to the main navigation displaying all user recurring queues.
2. Each queue card displays: original post content preview, interval, status (active/paused/completed), next scheduled time, and execution count.
3. Active queues display "Pause" and "Edit" buttons.
4. Paused queues display "Resume" and "Edit" buttons.
5. Clicking "Pause" changes queue status to "paused" and stops automatic scheduling.
6. Clicking "Resume" changes queue status to "active" and recalculates `nextScheduledTime`.
7. Clicking "Edit" opens a modal allowing changes to interval, max executions, and next scheduled time.
8. A "Delete Queue" option permanently removes the queue from the database (with confirmation prompt).

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story completes the user-facing queue management interface for Epic 4's recurring post system. Users can view all their recurring queues, pause/resume automated scheduling, edit queue settings, and delete queues they no longer need.

**Key Design Decisions:**

- Queues page is a dedicated route (/queues) in the main navigation
- Status-based filtering (All/Active/Paused/Completed) helps users find relevant queues
- Action buttons are context-aware: active queues show Pause, paused queues show Resume
- Edit functionality uses modal to keep users on the same page (no navigation)
- Delete requires confirmation to prevent accidental data loss
- UI updates automatically via Convex reactivity (no manual refresh needed)

[Source: docs/prd/6-epic-details.md:308-322]

### Data Models

This story uses the `recurring_queues` table defined in Story 4.3:

**Relevant fields:**
- `clerkUserId: v.string()` - User ownership
- `originalPostId: v.id("posts")` - Reference to original post
- `status: v.string()` - "active" | "paused" | "completed"
- `interval: v.number()` - Days between executions
- `nextScheduledTime: v.number()` - Timestamp of next execution
- `lastExecutedTime: v.optional(v.number())` - Timestamp of last execution
- `executionCount: v.number()` - Total executions
- `maxExecutions: v.optional(v.number())` - Optional execution limit

**Backend queries/mutations used:**
- `api.queues.getQueues` - Fetch user's queues (with optional status filter)
- `api.queues.pauseQueue` - Set queue status to "paused"
- `api.queues.resumeQueue` - Set queue status to "active"
- `api.queues.updateQueue` - Update queue settings
- `api.queues.deleteQueue` - Delete queue

[Source: docs/stories/4.3.recurring-queue-data-model-scheduler.md, convex/schema.ts]

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 4.3 (Recurring Queue Data Model & Scheduler):**

- All queue CRUD mutations are in `convex/queues.ts`
- `getQueues` query supports optional status filtering
- `pauseQueue` and `resumeQueue` mutations handle status transitions
- `resumeQueue` recalculates nextScheduledTime when resuming
- All mutations enforce user authentication and ownership

[Source: docs/stories/4.3.recurring-queue-data-model-scheduler.md]

**From Story 3.2 (Create/Edit/Delete Templates UI):**

- Similar UI patterns: list page with cards, edit modal, delete confirmation
- Can reuse UI patterns from Templates page for consistency
- TemplateFormModal demonstrates modal form pattern
- Templates page shows how to handle loading/empty states

[Source: docs/stories/3.2.create-edit-delete-templates-ui.md]

**From Story 2.5 (Post Management - Edit/Delete/Reschedule):**

- Delete confirmation pattern using AlertDialog
- Edit modal pattern for updating records
- Success/error toast notifications for user feedback

### UI/UX Design Patterns

**Queue Card Layout:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Status Badge]                 [Edit] [🗑️]  │
│                                              │
│ "This is the original post content preview  │
│  that will be reposted..."                   │
│                                              │
│ 🔄 Every 7 days                              │
│ 📅 Next: Feb 15, 2024 at 10:00 AM           │
│ ✓ Executed 3 of 10 times                    │
│                                              │
│           [Pause]  or  [Resume]              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Status Badge Colors:**
- Active: Green/success color (indicates queue is running)
- Paused: Orange/warning color (indicates queue is temporarily stopped)
- Completed: Gray/muted color (indicates queue finished all executions)

**Empty State:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                              │
│              🔄                              │
│    No recurring queues yet                   │
│                                              │
│  Create a recurring queue to automatically   │
│  repost your content at regular intervals    │
│                                              │
│         [Create Your First Queue]            │
│                                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Tech Stack & Libraries

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.5.4 (App Router), React 19, shadcn/ui components, Tabler icons
- **Backend**: Convex queries and mutations
- **State Management**: Convex `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks, React `useState` for modal visibility
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui Card, Dialog, AlertDialog, Button, Badge
- **Date Formatting**: date-fns library (e.g., `format(date, "PPpp")` for readable dates)

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Date/Time Formatting

**Next scheduled time display:**
```typescript
import { format } from 'date-fns';

const formattedTime = format(new Date(queue.nextScheduledTime), "PPpp");
// Output: "Feb 15, 2024 at 10:00 AM"
```

**Interval display:**
```typescript
const intervalText = queue.interval === 1
  ? "Every day"
  : `Every ${queue.interval} days`;
```

**Execution count display:**
```typescript
const countText = queue.maxExecutions
  ? `Executed ${queue.executionCount} of ${queue.maxExecutions} times`
  : `Executed ${queue.executionCount} times`;
```

### Testing

**Test Locations:**
- Component tests: `components/features/QueueList.test.tsx`, `QueueCard.test.tsx`, `QueueEditModal.test.tsx`
- Page tests: `app/queues/page.test.tsx` (optional)

**Testing Framework:**
- Jest for unit tests
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Mock Convex hooks: `useQuery`, `useMutation`

**Key Test Cases:**
1. Unit: QueueCard displays all queue information correctly
2. Unit: Action buttons rendered based on queue status
3. Integration: Clicking Pause button calls pauseQueue mutation
4. Integration: Clicking Resume button calls resumeQueue mutation
5. Integration: Clicking Edit button opens QueueEditModal
6. Integration: QueueEditModal form validation works correctly
7. Integration: Clicking Delete button shows confirmation dialog
8. Integration: Confirming deletion calls deleteQueue mutation
9. UI: Status filter tabs filter queues correctly
10. UI: Empty state displays when no queues exist

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Accessibility Considerations

- All action buttons must have clear aria-labels (e.g., "Pause queue", "Resume queue", "Edit queue settings", "Delete queue")
- Status badges should use aria-live regions for dynamic updates
- Modal dialogs must trap focus and return focus on close
- Keyboard navigation: Tab through cards and buttons, Enter to activate
- Delete confirmation dialog must be accessible (focus on cancel button by default for safety)
- Empty state should have proper heading hierarchy (h2 or h3)

### Performance Considerations

**Optimizations:**
- Use Convex's reactive queries for automatic UI updates (no polling needed)
- Filter and sort queues on client side (data set is small for single user)
- Lazy load QueueEditModal component (only when opened)
- Use shadcn/ui's optimized components for fast rendering

**Scalability:**
- For MVP (single user), all queues can be loaded at once
- For multi-user version: implement pagination or virtual scrolling if queue count grows large
