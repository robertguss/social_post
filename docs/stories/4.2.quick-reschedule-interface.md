# Story 4.2: Quick Reschedule Interface

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** content creator,
**I want** to quickly reschedule a cloned post with smart time suggestions,
**so that** I can batch schedule recurring content efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When cloning a post, the scheduling interface displays "Quick Reschedule" suggestions.
2. Suggestions include: "+1 week", "+1 month", "+3 months" relative to the original post's scheduled time.
3. Clicking a suggestion auto-fills the new scheduled time(s) for the selected platform(s).
4. Users can override suggestions and manually select any date/time.
5. The rescheduled post maintains the same platform selection as the original (Twitter, LinkedIn, or both).
6. A preview shows "Scheduled for {date/time}" before final confirmation.
7. Confirmation creates the scheduled post and displays success feedback.
