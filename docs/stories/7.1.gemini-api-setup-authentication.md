# Story 7.1: Gemini API Setup & Authentication

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As an** engineer,
**I want** to configure Google Gemini API access and authentication,
**so that** the application can make AI-powered content suggestions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A Gemini API key is obtained from Google AI Studio and stored as a Convex environment variable.
2. A Convex action is created that authenticates with the Gemini API using the stored API key.
3. The action successfully makes a test request to the Gemini API and receives a response.
4. Error handling is implemented for authentication failures (invalid API key, network errors).
5. API requests are logged for debugging and monitoring purposes.
6. Documentation is created detailing how to set up the Gemini API key in the project.
7. The Gemini API client is initialized with appropriate model selection (e.g., `gemini-1.5-flash` for cost efficiency).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 2: Add GEMINI_API_KEY to Convex environment variables** (AC: 1)
- [ ] **Task 3: Create Gemini client initialization action** (AC: 2, 7)
- [ ] **Task 4: Implement test request function** (AC: 3)
- [ ] **Task 5: Add error handling for API failures** (AC: 4)
- [ ] **Task 6: Implement API request logging** (AC: 5)

- [ ] **Task 8: Write tests for API authentication** (AC: 2-5)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

First story in Epic 7 (AI Content Assistant). Establishes foundation for Gemini AI integration.

**Important:** User indicated Gemini API needs to be set up first, so this story includes obtaining API access.
